Hi!

<h4>That's a simple way to build you Grafana+Prometheus+Loki+Promptail. I'm not here to explain one by one, however, follow the numbers to do your Monitore System with them in Kubernetes Cluster.</h4>

<p>OBS:</p> 
    <p>- I supposed you're using a AKS cluster from Azure with Storage Account and Share Files created before.</p>
    <p>- I'm using a namespace name "monitoring".</p>
    <p>- Whether you change some parameter, guarantee you change where they are filled.</p>
    <p>- That're a bunch of ways to do your Grafana with tools (prometheus, loki, etc), but, this is a simple way what i used to contribute for community.</p>
